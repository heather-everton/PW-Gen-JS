We all have to create passwords every day for various types of data and on top of that reset our passwords for the many applications we're running. Each application has different criteria for the type of passwords they need. Now you can generate a custom password each time for all your security needs. 

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused being productive not trying to come up with uniique passwords all the time.
* You shouldn't be using the same password for everything you access. 
* You should be able to pick exactly what type of password you need each time. 

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
